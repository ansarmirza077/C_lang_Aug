1)what are signed and unsigned datatypes?
Ans:signed datatypes indicate that it can hold both positive and negative values,where as a unsigned datatypes indicate
that it can hold both positive and negative values.

2)Datatypes by default are signed or unsigned?
Ans: Int by default holds signed values because integer has both positive and negative values.
	char can hold either signed or unsigned mostly depends on compiler.(Negative char does not exist) 
Note: If the datatype holds unsigned value its range does not changes but shifts towards positive.

3)const int* same as int const* --> pointer can point to a constant int and value of int pointed by this pointer cannot be changed.
4)const int* const --> pointer can point to a constant int and value of int pointed by this pointer cannot be changed,
		as we cannot change the value of pointer as well it is now constant and it cannot point to another constant int.
